# Notes

## The Method

1. Quickly add a test.
2. Run all tests and see the new one fail.
3. Make a little change.
4. Run all tests and see them all succeed.
5. Refactor to remove duplication.

## Two strategies for making things go green

* Fake It—Return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables
until you have the real code.

* Use Obvious Implementation—Type in the real implementation.
